## The purpose of the site 

This site is for one thing, and one thing only. To bring high-speed internet to Seward County, Nebraska. We are tired of the excuses, the stalled out video, and the over-priced "lucky to have us" service. It is time for something better.

We have a visual on the site, and this is going to be great. I have just to design the darn thing. When that is done, I am home free. What is taking so long, not even sure man.

### Some info!
